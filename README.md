# Troubleshooting

## Finding your `device_address`

Use IP address assigned by your router. It is recommended to use static DHCP by configuring in your router settings.  
If you don't know your IP address issued by your router, you have three options.
1. Access your router settings and view which IP it is issuing.
2. In Windows network settings, find IPv4 address under `Hardware properties` of your network device.
3. Run `node deviceList.js` to confirm and use the `addr` assigned by your router.

## What are the `cap_filter` values for my game server?

If you have configured `device_address` correctly, running `node findChannel.js` will log valid Channel IP address and data to the terminal if it includes `<ALL_CHANNELS>` in the message while running Mabinogi.  
If you have successfully logged your channel IP, log all IP addresses by channel hopping. To make the process faster, you may send bugle messages yourself.  
Once you have collected all IP addresses, find common value and substitute `211.218.233` appropriately. Leaving out values will automatically match source IP partially.
